When creating a Chrome extension or app, you need to provide a set of icons for
context menus, browser actions, page actions, and the Chrome Web Store. Usually,
these are just resized versions of the same image. The goal of
chrome-manifest-iconify is to intelligently handle the tedious process of
generated all these resized clones. All you need to do is provide it a master
icon and [v2 manifest](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest) file.
It will parse the manifest to determine the sizes, names, types, and paths of
the icons it needs to generate. You can choose from several resizing algorithms
as provide by [JIMP](https://github.com/oliver-moran/jimp) so your entire icon
set looks awesome.

## Installation
